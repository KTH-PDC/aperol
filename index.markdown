"**A**pplication **Per**spective **o**n SYC**L**" (APerOL) is a series
of minisymposia organized at the [Platform for Advanced Scientific Computing (PASC) Conference](https://www.pasc-conference.org/)
since 2023.

The minisymposia series focuses on advancing high-performance computing (HPC) through the adoption of [SYCL](https://www.khronos.org/sycl/), a vendor-agnostic standard
that promotes performance portability and interoperability across diverse hardware.
By fostering cross-disciplinary collaboration, the series aims to address the challenges posed by proprietary programming
models and vendor lock-in.
The presenters discuss best practices for developing maintainable, performant, and portable software using SYCL.
Through open discussions and inter-disciplinary discussion,
the series seeks to build an open software ecosystem that supports scientific innovation and reproducibility,
ultimately contributing to the broader adoption of open standards in scientific computing and paving
the way for sustainable performance-portability for the HPC codes.

The minisymposia are organized by

and
<a href="https://www.kth.se/profile/pszilard">Szilárd Páll</a>
from
[PDC Center for High Performance Computing at KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.pdc.kth.se/).

This summer, we will hold [a third minisimposium in the series]({% post_url 2025-06-18-pasc-25 %}) at [PASC'25 (June 16-18) in Brugg](https://pasc25.pasc-conference.org/).
We are inviting everyone interested to attend!
