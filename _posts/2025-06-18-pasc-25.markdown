The third minisymposium in the series will be organized at [PASC'25](https://pasc25.pasc-conference.org/) in a town of Brugg.
Featuring talks by Peter Thoman, Abhishek Bagusetty, Markus Büttner, and Timothée David--Cléris.

## Minisymposium abstract

HPC and data-intensive computing now stand as the fourth pillar of science. The heterogeneous architectures, primarily GPUs, are a
staple of HPC. However, the fast pace of development and increasing diversity of hardware bring forth not only new opportunities,
but also challenges. Proprietary heterogeneous programming models often pose risks due to vendor lock-in, hurting collaboration
and limiting portability, hence undermining reproducibility in scientific research. SYCL, a vendor-agnostic, C++-based standard for
heterogeneous computing with several mature implementations for a wide range of hardware accelerators, offers a promising path towards
vendor-agnostic, high-performance computing. This minisymposium focuses on the experiences of scientific application developers
using SYCL as a performance-portability solution across different hardware accelerators, fostering a collaborative open-software
ecosystem. The talks will focus on best practices for developing performance-portable and maintainable code using SYCL, as well as on
co-development and interaction between the SYCL Working Group and application developers. The aim of this workshop is to contribute
to the wider adoption of open standards in scientific computing.

The shallow water equations model fluid flow in regions where the horizontal scale is much larger than the vertical depth. Applications
of the shallow water equations include the modelling of tides, tsunamis or atmospheric flows. In this talk, we will discuss a
SYCL implementation of a discontinuous Galerkin discretization for the two dimensional shallow water equations with application
to coastal ocean simulations. We will first have a brief discussion of the discontinuous Galerkin discretization and important
performance characteristics of the resulting scheme on unstructured grids. We will then show how this scheme can be implemented in
SYCL, what abstractions are necessary for different architectures, and highlight differences between compilers and backends. At last,
we briefly discuss energy efficiency for our code across the tested architectures and give a brief outlook on how block-structured
grids can be used to improve simulation performance.
