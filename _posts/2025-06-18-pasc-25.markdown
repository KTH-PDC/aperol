The third minisymposium in the series will be organized at [PASC'25](https://pasc25.pasc-conference.org/) in a small town of Brugg.
Featuring talks by Peter Thoman, Abhishek Bagusetty, Markus Büttner, and Timothée David--Cléris.

## Minisymposum abstract

HPC and data-intensive computing now stand as the fourth pillar of science. The heterogeneous architectures, primarily GPUs, are a
staple of HPC. However, the fast pace of development and increasing diversity of hardware bring forth not only new opportunities,
but also challenges. Proprietary heterogeneous programming models often pose risks due to vendor lock-in, hurting collaboration
and limiting portability, hence undermining reproducibility in scientific research. SYCL, a vendor-agnostic, C++-based standard for
heterogeneous computing with several mature implementations for a wide range of hardware accelerators, offers a promising path towards
vendor-agnostic, high-performance computing. This minisymposium focuses on the experiences of scientific application developers
using SYCL as a performance-portability solution across different hardware accelerators, fostering a collaborative open-software
ecosystem. The talks will focus on best practices for developing performance-portable and maintainable code using SYCL, as well as on
co-development and interaction between the SYCL Working Group and application developers. The aim of this workshop is to contribute
to the wider adoption of open standards in scientific computing.
