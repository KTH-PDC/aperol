The first minisymposium in series took place at PASC'23 in beautiful Davos.

Gathered in a conference room of Congress Center Davos, early adopters of SYCL programming model shared
their experiences using it for performance and portability for different scientific codes.

From the intricate world of sparse linear algebra with _Ginkgo_ to the seismic simulations of _SeisSol_,
the session was a testament to the versatility of SYCL in tackling some of the most demanding computational problems.
_WarpX_ showcased how SYCL is being harnessed to simulate particle accelerators with unprecedented precision,
while the _ACTS_ project demonstrated its potential in reconstructing charged particle tracks in high-energy physics experiments.
